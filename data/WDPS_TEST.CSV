question-058<TAB>When was the first computer virus discovered?<newline>,1980s,   first computer virus discovered?,"Who discovered it and what was its impact on the computer world?

Answer: The first computer virus was discovered in 1983 by a student at the University of Southern California named Fred Cohen. At the time, Cohen was working as a consultant for the Los Angeles County Health Department, where he was tasked with developing a program to detect and remove viruses from computers.

The virus that Cohen discovered was called ""Elkclhorn"" and it infected Apple II computers. It was designed to overwrite the computer's memory with random data, causing the system to crash. The virus spread through floppy disks and was particularly dangerous because it could survive even if the infected disk was not booted.

The discovery of Elkclhorn marked a turning point in the history of computer viruses, as it highlighted the potential dangers of these malicious programs to both individuals and organizations. Prior to this, many people were not aware of the existence of computer viruses, let alone their potential impact.

Cohen's discovery of Elkclhorn led to the development of anti-virus software and raised awareness about the importance of protecting against viruses. Today, computer","{'text': ['1980s'], 'answer_start': [-1]}"

question-084<TAB>Which gas is responsible for the color of the sky?<newline>,Nitrogen, gas  responsible   color   sky?,"   rays from the sun are scattered by the gases in the earth's atmosphere, giving the sky its blue color. This scattering effect is due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, which is caused by the interaction between the sun's light and the gas molecules in the atmosphere. Specifically, the gas that is primarily responsible for the blue color of the sky is nitrogen (N2), as it makes up about 78% of the Earth's atmosphere and has a strong scattering effect on shorter wavelengths of light such as blue and violet.

Therefore, the answer is:

B) Nitrogen (N2).","{'text': ['Nitrogen'], 'answer_start': [365]}"

question-086<TAB>When was the Russian Revolution?<newline>,1917,   russian revolution?,"  The Russian Revolution, also known as the Great October Socialist Revolution, took place in two stages: the February Revolution in 1917 and the October Revolution in the same year.

The February Revolution began on March 8 (February 23 in the Julian calendar), when a combination of economic hardship, food shortages, and war weariness led to mass protests and strikes in Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg). The protests eventually forced Tsar Nicholas II to abdicate, and a provisional government was established.

The October Revolution, which was led by the Bolshevik Party under Vladimir Lenin, took place on November 7 (October 25 in the Julian calendar). The Bolsheviks, who had been secretly organizing in Russia for years, seized power from the provisional government and established the world's first socialist state.

So, the Russian Revolution took place in two stages: the February Revolution in March 1917, and the October Revolution in November 1917.","{'text': ['1917'], 'answer_start': [133]}"

question-107<TAB>Is ice cold?<newline>,Yes, ice cold?,"If so, how does it get that way?

Question 107 is a good example of an ice-related question that could be answered by discussing the properties of ice and how it forms. Ice is indeed cold, but not because it is made of water; rather, it is the reverse: water is made of ice. In other words, the molecules in ice are arranged in such a way that they form a rigid crystal lattice structure, which makes them move very slowly and gives ice its characteristic hardness and brittleness.

The reason ice is cold has to do with the way it forms. When water freezes, it does so from the top down, and as it does so, it releases heat. This process is known as exothermic freezing, and it results in a net loss of heat from the system. As a result, the temperature of the ice is lowered, making it colder than the surrounding water.

So, to answer the question, ice is indeed cold because of the way it forms through exothermic freezing. This process releases heat from the system, causing the temperature of the ice to be lowered relative to the surrounding water.","{'text': ['Yes'], 'answer_start': [-1]}"

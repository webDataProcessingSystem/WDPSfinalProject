To implement a system that receives a text (question or more general input), retrieves raw text from a language model, extracts an answer, checks correctness, and identifies entities, you can follow these general steps using a language model like GPT-3.5 or a similar one:

1. Set Up Your Development Environment:
Choose a programming language that suits your needs. Python is commonly used for tasks like these.
Utilize an appropriate API or library to interact with the language model. OpenAI's GPT-3 API, for example.

2. Communicate with the Language Model:
Use the API to send your input text (A) to the language model and retrieve the raw text (B).
Make sure to handle the authentication and manage API requests properly.

3. Extract the Answer:
Process the raw text (B) to extract the answer. The method will depend on the nature of the question. For yes/no questions, you might look for keywords or patterns indicating a positive or negative response.
For questions seeking a Wikipedia entity, you can use named entity recognition (NER) or similar techniques to identify relevant entities.

4. Check Correctness:
If the extracted answer is of a yes/no type, compare it with a set of predefined correct answers to determine correctness.
If the answer is an entity, you might check if the entity exists in a knowledge base like Wikipedia.

5. Entity Extraction:
Use NER techniques to identify entities in both the input text (A) and the raw text from the language model (B).
Compare the entities from both texts to see if there are any differences or additional entities in the raw text.

6. Implement and Test:
Combine all the steps into a cohesive program.
Test the system with various inputs to ensure it behaves as expected.
Address any issues or refine the system based on the test results.

Here's a simple Python-like pseudocode to illustrate these steps:

```python
# Assume you have a function to communicate with the language model called query_language_model
def query_language_model(input_text):
    # Implement the communication with the language model API here
    # Return the raw text received from the language model

def extract_answer(raw_text):
    # Implement answer extraction logic based on the nature of the question
    # Return the extracted answer

def check_correctness(extracted_answer, correct_answers):
    # Implement correctness checking logic
    # Return whether the extracted answer is correct or incorrect

def extract_entities(text):
    # Implement entity extraction logic using NER or other techniques
    # Return a list of entities

# Example usage
input_text = "What is the capital of France?"
raw_text = query_language_model(input_text)
extracted_answer = extract_answer(raw_text)
correctness = check_correctness(extracted_answer, ["Paris"])
entities_A = extract_entities(input_text)
entities_B = extract_entities(raw_text)

# Now you have the necessary information to provide the desired output
```
This pseudocode is a simplified representation, and you'll need to fill in the details based on the specifics of your implementation language and the capabilities of the language model API you are using. Additionally, handling edge cases and refining the logic based on testing and real-world data is crucial for a robust system.
